// First define the data you're going to be working with
// Data will need to be in the form of an array to make sense to D3
// Your array will most likely consist of objects with properties you can access
// Optionally (or rather preferably), you can read data from a file (eg JSON/CSV/TSV)

var data = [12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48];
